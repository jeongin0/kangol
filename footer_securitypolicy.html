                        <p>Personal data are shared with service providers (or data processors) subject to contracts prohibiting those service providers from selling personal data to other parties or using personal data for any purpose other than performing the services specified in the contract.</p>

                        <p>If we transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded to your personal data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>&#183; We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>
                            <li>&#183; Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
                            <li>&#183; Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>We process information entered on our sites in accordance with this policy. We do not consider this to be a “transfer” of personal data outside the EEA.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4 class="qsRG30">7. DATA SECURITY</h4>
                        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.

                        <h4 class="qsRG30">9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>
                        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:</p>
                        <p>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
                        <p>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
                        <p>Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you withdraw your consent on which processing was based and no other legal ground for processing your personal data exists, where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
                        <p>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
                        <p>Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>&#183; if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
                            <li>&#183; where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                            <li>&#183; where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                            <li>&#183; you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
                        <p>Withdraw consent where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
                        <span class="qsRG24">Non-Discrimination &amp; Exercising Your Rights</span>
                        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights described above. You may exercise any of these rights by emailing us at GlobalComplianceEthics@kangol.com or calling us toll-free at 1-866-852-6465.</p>
                        <span class="qsRG24">No fee usually required/Confirmation of Identity</span>
                        <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive, or as permitted by applicable law. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
                        <span class="qsRG24">Time limit to respond</span>
                        <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month, unless applicable law sets forth a shorter or longer period. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
                        <span class="qsRG24">Complaints</span>
                        <p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO, so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
